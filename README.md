1. Project's Title:
Billable Employees Application Tracker - BEAT

2. Project Description:
BEAT- Billable Employee Application Tracker
Demonstrate handling of Employee Hierarchy within an organisation and handles detailed description of each and every employee who are part of the organization. Employee hierarchy can be visualised as a Tree where in the employees report to their managers and there can be several employees under a superior management whose information we may need on one click. To handle information that cannot be gathered physically and to understand the overall organization structure we have come up with BEAT.
(If x works under y and y works under z, we can as far as reach out to y or even z to ask who he reports to but we physcially cannot reach z's reporting manager to ask who he works under) 
In this application we have considered all members from higher management level to lower level as employees. However, each employee in an organization has a different role to play and not each and every employee has the authority to perform all the CRUD operations. There are roles assigned to people to make changes to the projects of the organization. Similarly, not everyone can update or delete the employee's data. So, a different access group is associated with every employee to allow them different roles or permissions.
